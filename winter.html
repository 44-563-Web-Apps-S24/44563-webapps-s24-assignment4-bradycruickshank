        <p class="speech">Go away!</p>

        <h4 class="voitski">VOITSKI.</h4> <p class="speech">Soon the rain will be over, and all nature will sigh and awake
        refreshed. Only I am not refreshed by the storm. Day and night the
        thought haunts me like a fiend, that my life is lost for ever. My past
        does not count, because I frittered it away on trifles, and the present
        has so terribly miscarried! What shall I do with my life and my love?
        What is to become of them? This wonderful feeling of mine will be wasted
        and lost as a ray of sunlight is lost that falls into a dark chasm, and
        my life will go with it.</p>

        <h4 class="helena">HELENA.</h4> <p class="speech">I am as it were benumbed when you speak to me of your love, and
        I don't know how to answer you. Forgive me, I have nothing to say to
        you. [She tries to go out] Good-night!</p>

        <h4 class="voitski">VOITSKI.</h4> <p class="direction">[Barring the way]</p> <p class="speech">If you only knew how I am tortured by the
        thought that beside me in this house is another life that is being lost
        forever--it is yours! What are you waiting for? What accursed philosophy
        stands in your way? Oh, understand, understand----</p>
