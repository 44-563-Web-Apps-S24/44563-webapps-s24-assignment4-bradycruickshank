        <h1>Brady does Chekov tonight</h1>
        <h3>Uncle Vanya Act II by Anton Checkov</h3>

        <h4 class="serebrakoff">SEREBRAKOFF.</h4> <p class="direction">[Touched]</p> <p class="speech">Let us go, Marina.</p>

        <h4 class="marina">MARINA.</h4> <p class="speech">My own feet are aching so badly, oh, so badly!</p> <p class="direction">[She and SONIA
        lead SEREBRAKOFF out]</p> <p class="speech">Sonia's mother used to wear herself out with
        sorrow and weeping. You were still little and foolish then, Sonia. Come,
        come, master.</p>

        <p class="direction">SEREBRAKOFF, SONIA and MARINA go out.</p>

        <h4 class="helena">HELENA.</h4> <p class="speech">I am absolutely exhausted by him, and can hardly stand.</p>

        <h4 class="voitski">VOITSKI.</h4> <p class="speech">You are exhausted by him, and I am exhausted by my own self. I
        have not slept for three nights.</p>

        <h4 class="helena">HELENA.</h4> <p class="speech">Something is wrong in this house. Your mother hates everything
        but her pamphlets and the professor; the professor is vexed, he won't
        trust me, and fears you; Sonia is angry with her father, and with me,
        and hasn't spoken to me for two weeks; I am at the end of my strength,
        and have come near bursting into tears at least twenty times to-day.
        Something is wrong in this house.</p>

        <h4 class="voitski">VOITSKI.</h4> <p class="speech">Leave speculating alone.</p>

        <h4 class="helena">HELENA.</h4> <p class="speech">You are cultured and intelligent, Ivan, and you surely
        understand that the world is not destroyed by villains and
        conflagrations, but by hate and malice and all this spiteful tattling.
        It is your duty to make peace, and not to growl at everything.</p>

        <h4 class="voitski">VOITSKI.</h4> <p class="speech">Help me first to make peace with myself. My darling!</p> <p class="direction">[Seizes
        her hand.]</p>
